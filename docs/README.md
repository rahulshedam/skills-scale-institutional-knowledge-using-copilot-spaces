# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the documentation hub for OctoAcme's project management practices. Here you'll find a comprehensive overview of key workflows, roles, communication scheduling, and quality assurance methods that empower our teams to deliver consistent results. This README is intended as the starting point for onboarding, reference, and collaboration for all project contributors and stakeholders.

## Project Management Processes Overview

OctoAcme's approach is grounded in a customer-first mindset, iterative delivery, and a culture of clear ownership and continuous learning. Projects are led by a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Manager (PdM), with developers, QA, and stakeholders contributing distinct expertise. New work follows a defined lifecycle: Initiation (problem definition, stakeholder alignment), Planning (scope and milestones), Execution (build, test, track), Release (deploy and communicate), and Retrospective (capture learnings and improvements).

Central to our workflow are project boards (e.g., GitHub Projects) which track backlog, progress, review, QA, and completion. All initiatives use a Project One-pager, risk register, roadmap, and retrospective action logs as living artifacts. Planning involves creating a prioritized backlog, estimating effort, defining the Definition of Done, and identifying dependencies and risks—with all details tracked and shared for transparency. 

Communication happens at regular, predictable rhythms: daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly syncs for delivery review and risk tracking, milestone demos, and monthly stakeholder updates. Escalation is systematic, starting at the team level and rising to the product lead or sponsor where needed. Documented templates and checklists drive consistency in status reports, incident comms, and risk reviews.

Quality assurance is interwoven throughout each phase. All changes are covered by unit and integration tests, with manual QA and security scans before release. Key metrics—velocity, error rates, and business KPIs—are monitored via automated dashboards. Post-release, teams reflect on wins and lessons through structured retrospectives, ensuring a culture of continuous improvement.
